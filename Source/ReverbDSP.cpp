    The number of samples in these buffers is NOT guaranteed to be the same for every callback,
    and may be more or less than the estimated value given to prepareToPlay(). Your code must be able
    to cope with variable-sized blocks, or you're going to get clicks and crashes!

    Also note that some hosts will occasionally decide to pass a buffer containing zero samples,
    so make sure that your algorithm can deal with that!
