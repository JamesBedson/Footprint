## Purpose<a name="purpose"></a>

The purpose of this software is to provide an application for guitarists, bassists, and all other types of musicians that emulates instrument effect pedals commonly used in concerts and live-music setups. The software will be available as a VST or AU (Audio Units) plugin, allowing musicians to choose four different effects and connect them in series, either for live performances or recording purposes.
